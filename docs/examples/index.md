## Solution Integration Examples

The following links show how to use Terraform to integrate with your own apps and services, by using Ping Identity developed sample applications.  Demos that leverage Ping Identity's **BX*** demo brand are intended to provide wholistic code samples that can be copied to your own deployment and integration projects.

### BXRetail Sample App Package

* [Example at Ping Identity Developer Experience Github](https://github.com/pingidentity-developers-experience/ping-p1-terraform-sample-apps/tree/main/BXRetail-Terraform-pkg)

The **BXRetail Sample App Package** Github repository provides a sample app that uses [Ping Identity's OAuth/OIDC client SDK](https://github.com/pingidentity-developers-experience/ping-oidc-client-sdk), deployed and integrated with PingOne with Terraform.

The application is delivered in Ping Identity's demo branding for retail, called **BXRetail**.

### Developer Experience Example Packages
